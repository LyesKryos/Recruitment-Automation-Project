Recruitment Automation Program, Version 1.0.1a

Update Notes:

-Changes "Input your recruitment template" to "Input your recruitment template ID here"
-Fixes mistake in region checking that will customize the tgcanrecruit shard to your region
-Adds a "new tab" opening feature that will automatically open a new tab with the provided link when "Enter" is pressed.
-Added some time padding to the creation of new links, specifically if there is only one nation, to provide more time for nations to be generated.

--------------------------

What it does:
The Recruitment Automation Program complies a list of new nations from NationStates and inputs them into a link that you can copy. Additionally, it places your recruitment template into the link, meaning one less click for you to make. It also pads the generation time to give you the proper amount of time between link generations. For example, if a link for 4 nations is generated, at least 40 seconds will elapse before the next link is generated.

How to start:
Simply download the file off github, open it, and follow the prompts. If you download the .zip file (recommended), you'll need to decompress the file as well. Once you are finished recruiting, you can simply close the prompt. Note that a small beep sound will be made for each link generated.

What do to if something breaks:
No worries! Code goes haywire all the time. If you have issues with running the code, pause and wait a while to see if the problem relates to your computer, internet, or the NS servers. If not, contact the developer at Lies Kryos#1734 on Discord.

Why the verification?
Verification is required, plain and simple. It protects you (the user), me (the developer), and the benefitting party (the region you are using your recruitment for). If something goes horribly wrong and the program is abused, hopefully verification will keep the damage minimal.
